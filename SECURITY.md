## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/urmzd/dispatch/security/advisories/new). Do not open a public issue for security reports.

You can expect an acknowledgment within 72 hours. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure with you.

The sandbox layer (`pkg/sandbox`) is a security boundary: any way for a tool to read or write workspace keys outside its policy's areas is a vulnerability, not a bug.
